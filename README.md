# RandomNightLight

Have some digitally controllable lights (for example LEDs) that you want to fade in or out in a random sequence depending on the light level? Do you also have an extra Arduino lying around and a photoresistor? This is the program for you!

The Arduino Uno can light from zero to six lights using this program, though in practice it's overkill if you have fewer than two lights.

In general, you should just be able to modify the user settings at the top of lights.ino.  I'll leave wiring the lights up to you.
